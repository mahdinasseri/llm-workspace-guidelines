## Our Coexistence with AI in Data Analysis

These days in our marketing team, Artificial Intelligence and Large Language Models (GenAI/LLM) are almost present in all steps of the data analysis cycle: from problem finding and problem definition to framing, implementation, final analysis, and even data storytelling. These tools increase both speed and quality of work, and sometimes they act like an ‚Äúall-knowing assistant.‚Äù

But together with these opportunities, important questions also appear:

* Can AI make mistakes?
* Can our data become unsafe?
* Can it bias us toward existing methods?
* Can it slowly make us lazy and move us away from our own skills?
* What is really our role, and which skills should we develop?

These concerns are not only ours. Almost everywhere in the world people are facing the same questions. At the level of law and data governance, regulators have not yet reached a final ‚Äúbest practice.‚Äù Some large companies, especially those closer to governments or with more traditional structures, have banned the use of ChatGPT inside their organizations and even blocked it on internal networks. Still, many employees use these tools with their personal devices; after all, who would not like to have a fast and easy assistant that helps to do things better?

On the other hand, many leading organizations have adapted quickly: they built their own internal LLMs, encouraged employees to use them, and created new processes and solutions with their help. Many others still have no clear position and prefer to wait and see which successful models will appear in the world.

The reality is that challenges of data governance, productivity, and employee career paths are still not fully clear. However, we decided not to wait passively but to create a temporary framework for using this technology. This framework has turned into a code of conduct for using such tools: a set of do‚Äôs and don‚Äôts, principles, red lines, and useful recommendations.

Now, I decided to share this guideline of using ChatGPT in data analysis processes of our marketing team with you. You can use it as it is, or give suggestions for improving and upgrading it.
