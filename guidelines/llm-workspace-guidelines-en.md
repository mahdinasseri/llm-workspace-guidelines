# Guideline for Using GenAI in Data Analysis of the Marketing Team  

## 1. Purpose  
To define principles, requirements, and best practices for safe, responsible, and efficient use of GenAI tools (such as ChatGPT and other LLMs) across the full data analysis cycle of the marketing team: from problem finding, problem definition and framing, solution design, and implementation to final analysis and data storytelling.  

## 2. Concerns and Challenges  
- **Accuracy of results:** Possibility of model error and incorrect outputs.  
- **Data security:** Risk of exposing sensitive data.  
- **Bias and limitation:** Over-reliance on model-suggested methods and team bias.  
- **Skill reduction:** Risk of laziness and weakening of analytical and programming abilities of team members.  
- **Career path ambiguity:** Lack of clarity in professional growth and development paths for team members.  

## 3. Key Principles  
- **GenAI is an assistant, not a replacement:** Language models must be used as supportive tools to increase productivity and creativity, not as decision-makers or replacements for human skills.  
- **Verification of results:** Every GenAI output must be reviewed by an analyst or the team before being used in decision-making or presented to management.  
- **Maintain security and confidentiality:** No raw data or full database structures should be directly entered into external tools.  
- **Skill development:** Learning prompt-writing principles, critical analysis skills, and understanding the logic of generated code are priorities.  

## 4. Team Role and Skill Development  
- **Human role:** Defining the problem, setting success criteria, verifying outputs, and making the final judgment.  
- **Skill development:** Critical analysis, data-driven thinking, prompt-writing, programming skills, and understanding models.  
- **Conscious use:** GenAI is an accelerator tool; team skills must continue to improve to avoid negative dependency.  

## 5. Practical Guidelines  

### 5.1 Data Security and Confidentiality  
- All customer information must be treated as highly confidential data. Entering, disclosing, or sharing any sensitive customer information when interacting with AI tools or language models is not allowed.  
- No raw data should be directly uploaded into public GenAI tools.  
- Do not disclose full database structures or sensitive keys directly.  
- If needed, anonymize or summarize data before use.  
- All interactions with AI tools or language models must be done through official and secure websites or platforms. Use of unofficial websites, chatbots, or intermediaries is not allowed.  
- Delete your chat history with LLMs after some time.  

### 5.2 Programming  
- Use the **pair programming** approach: either write the code yourself and ask GenAI to review it, or take code from GenAI and check and correct its logic yourself.  
- Do not copy-paste and run any code without understanding its logic.  
- Any integration of GenAI tools with the companyâ€™s internal software must only be done with written approval from the team manager.  
- For debugging and problem finding, GenAI is the first support tool, but the final result must be confirmed by you.  
- Use GenAI for final code cleaning and commenting, but always emphasize in the prompt that it must not change the code logic.  

### 5.3 Data Analysis and Storytelling  
- When presenting results or building reports, use GenAI for drafting, chart creation, ideation, and improving narratives.  
- In critical or sensitive decisions, AI or LLM outputs should only play a supportive role and not be considered the main source of decision-making.  
- Make sure to mention possible model biases in reports.  
- Be familiar with hallucinations in LLMs and ensure your narrative does not include them.  

### 5.4 Prompt-Writing and Context Transfer  
- To get accurate answers, describe the problem with enough details but without exposing sensitive data.  
- Team members must be familiar with prompt engineering principles to make their use more effective and secure.  

### 5.5 Documentation and Transparency  
- Any integration with GenAI tools or major use of them must be reported and approved by the team manager or direct supervisor before execution.  
- Each use of GenAI in a project must be documented in the project records (date, model, purpose of use).  
- Changes or decisions based on model output must be traceable.
